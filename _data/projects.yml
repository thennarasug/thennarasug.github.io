  description: Writing a Twitter bot is fun. Runs in android app via termux. The first part of the code reads the line in file(tweetthis.txt) and tweets it. Used python - twython and textblob (to filter based on sensitivity). Second part is to search the string in tamil or english which has more than specified no of retweets/likes and with sensitive score more than 0.25. This is the enhanced version of python-twitter-bot, thats liked with heroku and it does not support any dynamic arguments. Eventhing need to be hardcoded on the file before you run it.
